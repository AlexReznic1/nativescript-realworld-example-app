  > **This repository is heavy in development and not to be used for now!**

> ### NativeScript codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

### [Demo](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **NativeScript** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **NativeScript** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.

## How it works
This app works as a NativeScript real-world showcase and is based on [NativeScript](https://nativescript.org) 4.0.0 Angular/TypeScript style.
